My name is Jhosselyn Pugo. I am a students at AUPE. I will be talking about things I don't like about school

## Limitations

Schools limits things like you being being able to go out. It's sometimes hard to go out with my friends from other schools without thinking "I can't stay out too long because I have to go home since there's school tomorrow." There's times where I can't go to parties on friday or saturdays because I have to work. If I choose to go, the next is double the workload because I would be more tired and still having to do my work.
