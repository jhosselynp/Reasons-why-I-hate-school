# Reasons-why-I-hate-school
My name is Jhosselyn Pugo. I am a students at AUPE. I will be talking about things I don't like about school

## The overwhelming Workload 


As a student that has had more than 3 AP classes, there is usually a lot of homeowrk being given. Not to mention I also have high expectations of wanting to be one of the top students so a lot of studying would have to done before test or when trying reviewing things that I don't understand in class and more.
All these things impact the way I view school. I start hating the fact that there's too much work that I have to do, especially when many classes want to give multiple assignments at the same due date. This ultimately causes stress, academi burnout and more.
