## Waking up early

For the ones that have a schedule that starts 1st period, you have to be there at 8:00 A.M or around there to be there on time for class. This would mean I would have to wake up at 6 A.M to do breakfast for everyone and then get ready. This is already hard since I rather be sleeping than going to school. When I have a lot of homework and things to do, I usually stay up late, making it difficult for me to get myself out of bed in the morning.
