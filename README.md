# Reasons-why-I-hate-school
My name is Jhosselyn Pugo. I am a students at AUPE. I will be talking about things I don't like about school

## The overwhelming Workload 

As a student that has had more than more than 3 AP classes, there is usually a lot of homeowrk being given. Not to mention as a student who has high expectations of wanting to be one of the top students, a lot of studying would have to done before test, went reviewing things that I don't understand in class and more.
